This is a Python project that utilizes Pipenv for dependency management and virtual environment setup.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have Python installed (preferably version 3.8 or higher).
- You have Pipenv installed. If not, you can install it using `pip install pipenv`.

   pipenv install
   ```

3. (Optional) If you have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install the dependencies from it:
   ```sh
   pipenv install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

```sh
pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt
```
